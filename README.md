# Breast-Cancer

# Problem:

Breast Cancer Classification:

-> Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features

-> 30 features are used, examples:

  - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
  - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  - perimeter
  - area
  - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
  - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
  - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
  - symmetry 
  - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
-> Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features

-> Number of Instances: 569
-> Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
-> Target class:
     - Malignant
     - Benign
     
 
 # Conclusion:
 
-> Machine learning techniques (SVM) was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Benign with 97% accuracy

-> The technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in a automated fasion/

-> The technique can be further imporoved by combining Computer Vision/ML techniques to directly classify cancer using the tissue images
